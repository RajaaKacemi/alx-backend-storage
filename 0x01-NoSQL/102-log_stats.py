This module contains a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs
stored in MongoDB.
Database: logs
Collection: nginx
Display (same as the example):
    - First line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
    - Second line: Methods:
        5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT",
        "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s a
